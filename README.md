# Boston Patios API

Summer is upon us. We Bostonians have spent the winter cramped up, learning
to rue the day we moved to this frigid ice town. No more. Time to enjoy all the
amazing patios the various restaurants of Boston have to offer.

This application serves up the JSON representation of Boston's best patios. This
will allow other applications to use the data to allow you explore the patios that Boston has to
offer!

This is the Rails API backend that will be serve up JSON to a React and React Native
application. This project is to investigate setting up something similar to a microservice 
that only provides JSON and does not have the front end on the same server. Previous apps I've
build followed a monolith configuration and I wanted to learn this separated approach.

This also included beginning to develop an understanding of configuring the application
to allow for CORS. Future places I'd like to go with this API involve adding JSON web tokens to
authenticate the requests to secure the API.
